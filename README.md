# Clustering
**Made by Igor Markevych**
## Data
We have data from survey about favorite movies.  
  
## Goal
Goal is to perform two types of clustering - supervised and unsupervised.  
  
For unsupervised, K-Means was performed.  
For supervised, goal variable is one of two - either favorite movie or how much times per week person watchs movies.
Next methods of supervised learning were performed:
- k-NN
- SVM
- Naive Bayess
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Voting Classifier, based on best models from above
  
After models were created, goal variable should be predicted for `prof` file.
